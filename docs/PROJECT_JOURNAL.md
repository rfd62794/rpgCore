# rpgCore — Project Journal

## Current State
Protected test floor: 312 passing, 3 skipped, 0 failures.
Entry point: game.py with manifest-driven launcher.
Two demos playable: Slime Clan, Last Appointment.
Two demos stubbed: TurboShells, Asteroids.
Shared UI system complete in src/shared/ui/.
APJ tool live in src/tools/apj/.
Constitution formalized: four pillars, four laws, asset contract.

## In Flight
Asset restructure mapped in ASSET_INVENTORY.md — moves identified, not yet executed.
src/tools/ pillar exists in filesystem and constitution.

## Next Priority
Asset restructure — execute moves from ASSET_INVENTORY.md.
Then: TurboShells frame session or Last Appointment shared UI migration.
