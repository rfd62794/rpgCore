# rpgCore — Project Journal

## Current State
Protected test floor: 307 passing, 3 skipped, 0 failures.
Entry point: game.py with manifest-driven launcher.
Two demos playable: Slime Clan, Last Appointment.
Two demos stubbed: TurboShells, Asteroids.
Shared UI system complete: Panel, Label, TextWindow, Button, Card, CardLayout, ProgressBar, ScrollList, SceneBase.
Constitution formalized: four pillars, four laws, asset contract.

## In Flight
Asset restructure mapped in ASSET_INVENTORY.md — moves identified, not yet executed.
src/tools/ pillar exists in constitution but not yet in filesystem.

## Next Priority
APJ tool itself — this file plus the CLI that maintains it.
After that: asset restructure, TurboShells frame session, or Last Appointment migration to shared UI.
