# rpgCore — Goals

## G1 — Living Sandbox
rpgCore remains a forkable engine. Any demo worth shipping
gets branched. Engine improvements fold back in.

## G2 — Creature Collector
Genetics, combat, exploration, relationship tracking.
Proves the deepest expression of shared systems.

## G3 — Dungeon Crawler  
Procedural rooms, D20 depth, roguelike progression.
Exploration as the core verb.

## G4 — Engine Capability
Every new demo harvests something back into shared/.
No demo leaves the engine weaker than it found it.

## G5 — Portfolio Readiness
Three demos polished enough to show a hiring manager.
Clean repo, honest tests, compelling README.
