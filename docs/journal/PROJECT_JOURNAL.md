# rpgCore — Project Journal

## Current State
434 passing. Parser layer complete — frontmatter reader, corpus builder, ValidationResult. G10 parses correctly, M11 orphan caught as expected.

## In Flight
None.

## Next Priority
Phase 3 — wire build_corpus() into Archivist. Replace raw markdown reads with structured Corpus instances. Archivist findings become ValidationResult errors.
