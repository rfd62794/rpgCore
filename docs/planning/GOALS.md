# rpgCore — Goals

## G1 — Living Sandbox
rpgCore remains a forkable engine. Any demo worth shipping
gets branched. Engine improvements fold back in.

## G2 — Creature Collector
Genetics, combat, exploration, relationship tracking.
Proves the deepest expression of shared systems.

## G3 — Dungeon Crawler *(SUPERSEDED by G7)*
Procedural rooms, D20 depth, roguelike progression.
Exploration as the core verb.
Superseded by G7 which carries a linked Milestone (M8).

## G4 — Engine Capability
Every new demo harvests something back into shared/.
No demo leaves the engine weaker than it found it.

## G5 — Portfolio Readiness
Three demos polished enough to show a hiring manager.
Clean repo, honest tests, compelling README.

## G6 — Space Trader Demo
Simple economy, location-based prices, travel risk.
Reuses Slime Clan territory and Asteroids combat systems.
Core memory: Palm Pilot Space Trader, bus rides, simple fun.

## G7 — Dungeon Crawler Demo
Tactical combat, procedural rooms, loot and progression.
Draws from Final Fantasy structure and Diablo's feel.
Proves D20 depth, procedural generation, inventory systems.

## G8 — Creature Collector Demo
Genetics, combat, exploration, relationship tracking.
Draws from Pokemon and Dragon Quest Monsters.
Proves the deepest expression of shared systems together.

## G9 — TurboShells Phoenix
Genetic breeding, stable management, racing simulation.
The demo that was always planned, still waiting its moment.

## G10 — The Living World
Six Aspects of one Soul's journey through existence.
The Ring at the center where the Soul moves between all of them.
Each Aspect fully playable alone. Crossover always additive.
The mythology engine underlying Dugger's Green Box.

## G11 — Slime Breeder (Creation Aspect)
The Chao Garden of the Green Box.
Genetics, shapes, sizes, colors, patterns, personality.
TurboShells racing lives here as a mode.
Your creations enter the world and show up elsewhere.
