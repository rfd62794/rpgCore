# Dugger's Green Box — Vision

## The North Star
A collection of living worlds that reveal themselves
over time through systems the player masters
and creatures the player raises.

Gameplay reveals itself as a reward.
Intelligence through systems, not language models.
Depth through investment, breadth through procedural.
Discovery feels earned. Everything connects.

## The Question
"You came here by accident.
 You built something anyway.
 Now you can leave.
 Will you?"

## The Story
You crash-land on an alien world.
A garden was already here.
Slimes were already living in it.
You need ship parts to escape.
The parts are scattered across a living world.
The world has factions, history, secrets.
By the time you can leave —
you might not want to.

## The Core Loop
Breed → Deploy → Discover → Return
Slimes are companions, scouts, diplomats.
The garden is always home.
Loss is real. Breeding continues the legacy.

## The Garden (Hub)
Neutral ground. All factions respect it.
Where slimes live between adventures.
Starts as crash wreckage.
Becomes something beautiful over time.
The emotional anchor of the entire experience.

## The Four Worlds

### Slime Breeder
"What will my slimes become?"
Genetics and personality reveal over generations.
Attachment through raising. Mastery through breeding.
Chao Garden meets Pokemon breeding depth.
Breeds feed every other world.

### Dungeon Crawler
"What's in the next room?"
Ruins beneath the world.
Ship parts are down here.
So is the history of why you crashed.
Procedural floors. Systemic loot and builds.
Diablo 2 one-more-dungeon loop.
Party drawn from slimes you raised.

### Slime Conquest
"What can my squad achieve?"
Surface world. Faction territories.
FF Tactics-lite.
Procedural maps. Systemic strategy.
Optional map battles on casual missions.
Required on Core and Story missions.
Squads built from slimes you bred.
The stakes feel real because the slimes are yours.

### Slime Racing
"How fast can they go?"
How factions settle disputes peacefully.
First friendly contact with clans.
Win races → earn respect → unlock trade.
Genetics matter: agility, acceleration, drafting.
Chocobo Racing energy.

## The Faction World

### Five Slime Cultures
Evolved based on regional pressure.
Tendencies not locks — genetics can override.
Cultural traits visible in mathematical rendering.

Ember Slimes (Ember Wastes)
  Warriors. Resource rich.
  Angular forms. Hot palette.
  Trade: parts, weapons, combat training.

Crystal Slimes (Crystal Caverns)
  Scholars. Ancient knowledge.
  Geometric, faceted forms. Cool palette.
  Trade: information, maps, dungeon layouts.
  Know more about your crash than they say.

Moss Slimes (Moss Plains)
  Farmers. Abundant. Social.
  Rounded, soft forms. Green palette.
  Trade: breeding supplies, genetic materials.
  Most welcoming to outsiders.

Coastal Slimes (Coastal Waters)
  Traders. Adaptable. Fluid.
  Elongated forms. Blue-teal palette.
  Trade: routes, cargo, rare finds.
  Know every faction's price.

Void Slimes (Void Edges)
  Unknown pressure. Strange traits.
  Irregular, shifting forms. Dark with inner light.
  Movement feels deliberately uncanny.
  Factions fear them. Some worship them.
  Don't trade easily.
  Worth pursuing anyway.
  Best rewards. Highest risk.

### Faction Memory
Factions remember what you did.
Choices made while surviving
have consequences you didn't anticipate.
Alignment in Act 1 determines
who trusts you in Act 3.

### The Economy (Slime Clan)
Not your clan. The existing civilization.
Clans have territory, resources,
relationships, memory.
Your garden sits in contested territory.
The crash wasn't random.
Something brought you here.
The clans know what it was.
You don't. Yet.

## The Slimes

### Mathematical Rendering
Slimes are mathematically drawn, not sprited.
Genetics ARE the appearance.
Every slime is unique by definition.
The renderer reads genome parameters.
No artist bottleneck. No variant limit.
Cultural tendencies expressed through
parameter ranges, not locked values.

### Genetic Parameters → Visual Output
body_size         → overall scale
body_roundness    → ellipse ratio
primary_color     → main fill (HSL)
secondary_color   → pattern color
pattern_type      → spots/stripes/patches/none
pattern_density   → coverage amount
wobble_frequency  → pulse speed
wobble_amplitude  → pulse depth
eye_size          → eye radius
eye_spacing       → distance between eyes
cultural_base     → shape tendency + color range
rare_trait        → special visual effect

### Rare Traits
Void trait      → inner glow, dark body
Crystal trait   → faceted edges
Ember trait     → heat shimmer
Ancient trait   → markings from old civilization
Off-world trait → doesn't exist on this planet
                  brought by crashed travelers
                  including you

### Sub-Species
Deep breeding dilutes cultural base traits.
Unique combinations emerge.
Player creates their own sub-species.
The system generates them.
Player names and remembers them.
That is The Living World.

### Void Slimes
Not a culture. A convergent evolution.
Rarest traits. Most dangerous in dungeon.
Most valuable in conquest.
Breed one if you go deep enough.
The world has an edge.
Void Slimes live near it.
What's beyond that edge
is the Space question
answered without leaving the planet.

## The Mystery
Space is mythology, not game mode.
You crashed from somewhere.
There are other planets.
Other slime cultures exist out there.
The player doesn't visit them.
But the world implies they exist.
Previous travelers crashed here before you.
Your garden's neutral status is not accidental.
Something draws ships to this planet.
Design the mystery. Not the answer.

## Technical Constraints
No LLMs — intelligence through systems.
Mathematical rendering — genetics drive appearance.
Procedural stage — systemic meaning.
Systems create worlds. Not content.
Runs offline. Works in browser.
Saves via LocalStorage and export/import JSON.
Slimes connect every world.

## What We Are Not Building
LLM dialogue or behavior.
Procedural story generation.
Chosen one narrative.
Gating between worlds.
Space as playable game mode (v1-v3).
