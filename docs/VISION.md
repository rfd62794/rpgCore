# Slime Clan — Vision Document

## Premise

A stranded astronaut crashes on a planet locked in ancient feudal warfare between two slime factions. The player's only goal is to repair their ship and leave. Everything else — alliances, conquest, diplomacy — is a means to that end.

## Three Paths

All equally viable. None forced. The player's actions determine the ending, not dialogue choices.

### 🗡️ Conqueror
Dominate the planet. Subjugate factions. Extract what you need by force. The ship gets repaired because nobody is left to stop you.

### 🤝 Unifier
End the war. Broker peace between the factions. Build something worth staying for — or leave knowing you left the world better than you found it.

### 🚀 Survivor
Repair the ship quietly. Trade, scavenge, avoid entanglements. Leave before it gets complicated. The planet never knew your name.

## Narrative Principle

Plot and attachment emerge from play, never from cutscenes. The player should feel things before they're told to.

You recruit a slime to help carry materials and it saves your life in a skirmish. You name it. Now you care. That's the moment — and it happened because of gameplay, not a scripted sequence.

## Scope Boundary

Every feature must serve the astronaut's journey from crashed outsider to departure-ready. If a mechanic doesn't connect to ship repair, faction leverage, or survival on a hostile world — it's out of scope.
