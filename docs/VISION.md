# Slime Clan — Vision Document

## Premise

A stranded astronaut crashes on a planet locked in ancient feudal warfare between two slime factions. The player's only goal is to repair their ship and leave. Everything else — alliances, conquest, diplomacy — is a means to that end.

## Three Paths

All equally viable. None forced. The player's actions determine the ending, not dialogue choices.

### 🗡️ Conqueror
Dominate the planet. Subjugate factions. Extract what you need by force. The ship gets repaired because nobody is left to stop you.

### 🤝 Unifier
End the war. Broker peace between the factions. Build something worth staying for — or leave knowing you left the world better than you found it.

### 🚀 Survivor
Repair the ship quietly. Trade, scavenge, avoid entanglements. Leave before it gets complicated. The planet never knew your name.

## Narrative Principle

Plot and attachment emerge from play, never from cutscenes. The player should feel things before they're told to.

You recruit a slime to help carry materials and it saves your life in a skirmish. You name it. Now you care. That's the moment — and it happened because of gameplay, not a scripted sequence.

## Scope Boundary

Every feature must serve the astronaut's journey from crashed outsider to departure-ready. If a mechanic doesn't connect to ship repair, faction leverage, or survival on a hostile world — it's out of scope.

## The Four Factions

The planet has four distinct groups, each with their own identity and relationship to the war:

- **The Ember Clan (Red)** — Aggressive and expansionist. They were winning the war before the astronaut arrived. Militaristic culture, high aggression, low patience for outsiders. They see the crashed ship as a resource to be seized.
- **The Tide Clan (Blue)** — Defensive and ancient. They have held their territory for generations through discipline rather than aggression. They distrust outsiders but respect demonstrated strength.
- **The Astronaut (White)** — You. No territory, no history, no allegiance. Your color emerges on the map only as you build something. You are the only faction without a home.
- **The Unbound (Yellow)** — Tribal, scattered, neutral. They predate the war and refuse alignment with either clan. They remember what the planet was before the factions divided it. They don't fight for territory — they fight for themselves and their own. They are not hostile by default but they are not welcoming either. Trust must be earned.

## Recruitment Philosophy

The Ember and Tide Clans can be recruited through conquest or defection, but at a cost — taking their soldiers makes enemies. The Unbound are the natural recruitment pool for the astronaut. They carry no faction debt. Earning their trust is the core progression loop.

Recruitment methods are not yet defined but should involve demonstration rather than transaction. The Unbound respect capability, not currency.

## The Unbound Design Question

The Unbound exist in scattered tribal groups across unclaimed territory. They are neither aggressive nor passive — they respond to context. Three open design questions for future sessions:

1. **How do they join?** Do they recruit through combat (defeat and earn respect), relationship (repeated interaction), or demonstration (complete tasks)?
2. **Internal Politics**: Do they have their own internal hierarchy the player must navigate?
3. **Volatility**: Can they be lost — driven away by poor decisions or faction pressure?

## Day/Action System (Planned — Session 025)

Time on the overworld advances by player action, not real time. Each day the player has a limited action budget. Factions take their turn when the player ends their day.

Territories require garrisons to hold. Squads have upkeep costs. Expansion is limited by resources, not just ambition.

## Territory Purpose (Planned)

Nodes are not generic. Each has a type that determines its strategic value:

- **Resource Node** — generates materials for ship repair
- **Recruitment Site** — where Unbound tribes can be found
- **Defensive Stronghold** — high defensive bonus for garrison
- **Ship Parts Cache** — contains components needed for departure
