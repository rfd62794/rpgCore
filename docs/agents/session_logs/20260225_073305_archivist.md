## Session Primer
rpgCore has 442 passing tests across six playable demos including the Dungeon Crawler with a working combat loop.

## Queued Focus
> Link G3 to Milestone M7 or mark it deferred

## Open Risks
- G1: Living Sandbox → no milestone
- M5: All four demos playable

## Constitutional Flags
- ⚠️ LAW 1: T047 scoped shared but title references slime_breeder directly
- ⚠️ LAW 4 — The test floor is 442 passing tests
- ⚠️ LAW 2 — No content gating between demos
