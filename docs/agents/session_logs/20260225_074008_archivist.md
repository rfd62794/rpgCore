## Queued Focus
> Link G3 to Milestone M6 or mark it deferred

## Open Risks
- G1: Living Sandbox → no milestone
- M5: All four demos playable

## Constitutional Flags
- ⚠️ LAW 1 VIOLATION — Goals G1, G2, G4, G5, G6, G7, G8, G9, G10 are not linked to any milestone. Only G11 is linked.
- ⚠️ M1: All demos playable → M5
- ⚠️ G3: No linked Milestone — orphaned goal, should be linked or retired
