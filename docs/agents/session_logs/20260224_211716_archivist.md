**Model:** llama3.2:3b  
**Corpus Hash:** `e883e4ccf6883e136a1cc75b164041bfb295c13aa119343d9ed7820d5a26bf8f`

## Session Primer
rpgCore has 405 passing tests across six playable demos including the Dungeon Crawler with a working combat loop. The Archivist agent shipped last session and confirmed live corpus analysis.

## Queued Focus
> Link G3 to Milestone M5 or mark it deferred in GOALS.md

## Open Risks
- G3 in GOALS.md has no linked Milestone — orphaned goal, should be linked or retired
- Two TASKS.md items marked Active have no corresponding Active Milestone

## Constitutional Flags
- ⚠️ LAW 1 VIOLATION — tasks.md line 47 references slime_breeder directly inside a shared/ task description
