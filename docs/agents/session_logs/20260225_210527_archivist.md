## Queued Focus
> Link G1 to Milestone M5 or mark it deferred, Link G2 to Milestone M6 or mark it deferred

## Open Risks
- G1: Living Sandbox → no milestone
- M6: The Living World → M11 (no evidence in docs/reference/)
- M7: TurboShells Phoenix → M7 (no evidence in docs/reference/DUNGEON_DESIGN.md)
- G2: Creature Collector → no milestone
- G3: Dungeon Crawler Demo → M8 (no evidence in docs/reference/LIVING_WORLD.md)

## Constitutional Flags
- ⚠️ LAW 1: T047 scoped shared but title references slime_breeder directly (G1)
- ⚠️ LAW 4 — The test floor is 434 passing tests
