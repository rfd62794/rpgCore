**Corpus Hash:** `6c638dc4888ca1b947009e65f08bac3458750889327701de3d8f6f5ea235319c`

## Session Primer
The project has 462 passing tests with the corpus parser live and all goals linked to milestones.

## Queued Focus
> Link G3 to Milestone M6 or mark it deferred

## Open Risks
- G1: Living Sandbox → no milestone
- M5: All four demos playable

## Constitutional Flags
- ⚠️ LAW 1: T047 scoped shared but title references slime_breeder directly in goal G10
- ⚠️ LAW 4: The test floor is 462 passing tests
