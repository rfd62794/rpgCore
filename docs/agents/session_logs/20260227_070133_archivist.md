**Model:** base_agent_router  
**Corpus Hash:** `868bd3ae79c58bcf0be948266db8badff85b0e819f6d3bd32d86f2395f0d7fbb`

## Session Primer
The project has 494 passing tests with the corpus parser live. Momentum is focused on Archivist integration and agent swarm development.

## Queued Focus
> Link G3 to an Active Milestone or mark deferred in goals.yaml

## Open Risks
- G3 has no linked milestone — orphaned
- Three Active goals (G9_OLD, G10_OLD, G11_OLD) have no corresponding Milestone
- Active Milestones have no corresponding tasks

## Constitutional Flags
_No violations detected._
