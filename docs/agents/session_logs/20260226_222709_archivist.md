**Model:** base_agent_router  
**Corpus Hash:** `4df3595701fd63b9ef1ebed0f993b2a6a203eaf8f6c333f134e249e5ecc4fe53`

## Session Primer
The project holds 494 passing tests post-YAML migration with schema validation active. Momentum focuses on session tracking and corpus parser enhancements from the latest S005 work.

## Queued Focus
> Link G1 (Living Sandbox) to a Milestone or mark deferred in goals.yaml

## Open Risks
- Four Active Goals (G1, G2, G4, G5) have no linked Milestones — orphaned
- Active Milestone M5 (All four demos playable) has no associated tasks

## Constitutional Flags
_No violations detected._
