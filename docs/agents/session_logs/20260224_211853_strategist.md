**Model:** llama3.2:3b  
**Corpus Hash:** `e883e4ccf6883e136a1cc75b164041bfb295c13aa119343d9ed7820d5a26bf8f`

## Session Options

[R] HEADLONG — Combat Polish Pass [Low Risk]
  Advances: M8 — Dungeon Crawler Frame
  Rationale: M8 is the active milestone. Combat polish is the highest-value unblocked task. Low risk, high visibility.
  Tasks:
    1. Fix floating damage numbers in src/apps/dungeon/scenes/combat_scene.py
    2. Add hero portrait render to active combat slot
    3. Run pytest — target 408 passing
    4. Commit: polish: dungeon combat — damage numbers, hero portrait

[D] DIVERT — G3 Milestone Link [Low Risk]
  Advances: M5 — Core Frameworks Live (goal linking)
  Rationale: Fix G3 orphaned goal in GOALS.md by linking it to M5.
  Tasks:
    1. Review GOALS.md — identify the orphaned G3 goal
    2. Link G3 to M5 in GOALS.md
    3. Verify Archivist no longer flags G3 as orphaned

[A] ALT — APJ Toolchain Refactor [Low Risk]
  Advances: M3 — APJ Toolchain Live (enhancement)
  Rationale: Refactor APJ toolchain to reduce planning debt and improve future session setup.
  Tasks:
    1. Review apj.py — identify areas for refactoring
    2. Apply refactoring patches to apj.py
    3. Run pytest — target 409 passing

## Open Questions
- Should the combat polish target M8 completion this session or is a partial polish acceptable?
- Is the G3 milestone link Divert a prerequisite before any feature work, or can it run parallel?

## Archivist Risks Addressed
- Two TASKS.md items marked Active have no corresponding Active Milestone — addressed by Divert option
