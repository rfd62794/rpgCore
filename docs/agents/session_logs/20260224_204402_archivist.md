**Model:** llama3.2:3b  
**Corpus Hash:** `587e55e9508d596d3b3dc01b42735a1ee1e77681418a156c390b2ef8d321cb31`

## Session Primer
402 passing. Combat loop complete. Buttons fixed via Panel event propagation. Sable of Ashfall died on Floor 4. Hall of Ancestors recording.

## Queued Focus
> Verify llama3.2:3b is available via `ollama list` then run `python -m src.tools.apj session start`

## Open Risks
- TASKS.md has two items marked Active but no owner
- docs/GOALS.md references G3 which has no linked milestone

## Constitutional Flags
- ⚠️ LAW 1 — No demo-specific logic in src/shared/. Shared code must be generic.
- ⚠️ LAW 4 — The test floor is 402 passing tests. Do not regress below this.
