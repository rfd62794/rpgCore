# World Field Notes — Unnamed Planet

## The Planet
No name recorded yet.
The slimes have a name for it in their own language.
Nobody has translated it correctly.
The word seems to mean something between
"home" and "inevitable."

## The Five Regions

### The Ember Wastes
Hot. Dry. Resource rich beneath the surface.
Ember Slimes have lived here longest of any culture.
Angular formations in the rock mirror their forms.
Travelers who stay too long start to feel restless.

### The Crystal Caverns
Cold. Dark. Older than any other region.
The geometric formations predate the slimes.
Crystal Slimes did not build them.
They moved in. They studied what was already there.
The carvings on the deep walls are not slime-made.

### The Moss Plains
Warm. Abundant. Loud with life.
Moss Slimes are everywhere.
They are the most numerous culture by far.
They remember every visitor.
They share information freely.
This is either generosity or strategy.
Possibly both.

### The Coastal Waters
Always moving. Always trading.
Coastal Slimes have routes that predate
any known map of the surface.
They know things about the other regions
that the other regions do not know about themselves.
They charge for this information.
Everything has a price on the coast.

### The Void Edges
Nobody agrees on where they begin.
The other cultures avoid them.
The Void Slimes are not aggressive.
They simply exist in a way that feels wrong.
Their movement does not follow expected patterns.
Their forms shift in ways that should not be possible.
The Crystal scholars have studied them for generations.
They have stopped publishing findings.

## The Garden
Crash site. Neutral ground by old agreement.
The agreement predates any living slime's memory.
It is simply known: this place is neutral.
Nobody enforces it. Nobody violates it.
The garden existed before the most recent crash.
It will exist after.
Previous travelers left things here.
Most of it is overgrown now.
Some of it still works.

## The Ruins Beneath
Every region has them.
The ruins are not slime-built.
The Crystal scholars know this.
They do not say it to outsiders.
The deepest ruins contain things
that do not match any known slime culture
or any known off-world technology.
They are simply there.
They have always been there.
They function.

## What The Clans Know About The Crashes
Ships have been arriving for a long time.
Not frequently. Not on a schedule.
But consistently enough that
every living culture has a word for it.
The Moss Slimes call it "the falling stars."
The Crystal Slimes call it "the returning."
The Coastal Slimes call it "new cargo."
The Ember Slimes do not speak of it.
The Void Slimes smile when asked.

## What Nobody Knows Yet
Something draws ships here.
It is not accidental.
The garden is not neutral by chance.
The ruins beneath it are the deepest on the planet.
The Void Edges point toward something beyond the atmosphere.
The Crystal scholars stopped publishing findings
the year they reached the lowest level.
That was sixty years ago.
The scholar who led that expedition
still lives in the caverns.
She does not receive visitors.
