# Field Notes: The Living World

## The Planet
(Name pending classification)

## The Five Regions
The surface is divided by extreme environmental pressures, each giving rise to distinct lifeforms.

### Ember Wastes
A high-energy, resource-rich volcanic region. The terrain is jagged and the air is thick with heat. The dominant lifeforms are angular and resilient.

### Crystal Caverns
Deep subterranean networks of ancient geological formations. A place of silence and geometric perfection.

### Moss Plains
The most hospitable region. Rolling hills of dense, soft vegetation. Life here is abundant and social.

### Coastal Waters
Fluid and ever-changing. The intersection of land and sea requires high adaptability.

### Void Edges
Where the known world begins to fray. The atmosphere shifts, and life takes on irregular, uncanny forms that defy standard biological classification.

## The Garden (Your Crash Site)
A pocket of neutrality in a contested world. It appears the environment here intentionally fosters growth and stability. Previous evidence suggests it has served as a sanctuary for others before.

## The Ruins Beneath
Vast, ancient structures extending deep into the planetary crust. They hold the physical remains of the ship parts you seek, as well as the history of this world and the reason for the crashes.

## The Void Edges
Not merely a geographical boundary, but a site of convergent evolution. Void Slimes congregate here, exhibiting traits that suggest life from an entirely different pressure gradient.

## The Factions and Their History
The five primary Slime cultures have inhabited these regions for eons. They have established territories, alliances, and a long memory of those who have come from beyond the sky.

## What The Clans Know About The Crashes
The Clans understand that the crashes are periodic and non-accidental. They have watched travelers arrive, build, and either disappear into the world or attempt to leave.

## What Nobody Knows Yet
Something draws ships here. It is not accidental.
