## Session Options

[R] HEADLONG — YAML Event Loop Integration [Low Risk]
  Advances: M_LOOP — Event Loop YAML Integration
  Rationale: M_LOOP is the active milestone. Integrating YAML corpus into the event loop advances core engine capabilities and aligns with queued tasks.
  Tasks:
    1. Implement YAML event loading in src/shared/engine/event_loop.py
    2. Add pytest for YAML event parsing in tests/unit/engine/test_event_loop.py
    3. Run pytest --target 494 passing
    4. Commit: feat: integrate YAML event parsing into event loop system

[D] DIVERT — Task-Milestone Alignment Audit [Low Risk]
  Advances: M_LOOP — Event Loop YAML Integration
  Rationale: Proactively ensure queued tasks in TASKS.md align with M_LOOP and M_CULTURAL milestones, addressing potential planning debt.
  Tasks:
    1. Audit TASKS.md Queued section for M_LOOP/M_CULTURAL alignment
    2. Update MILESTONES.md with missing task links
    3. Commit: chore: align queued tasks with active milestones

[A] ALT — YAML Parser Test Coverage [Low Risk]
  Advances: M_LOOP — Event Loop YAML Integration
  Rationale: Smaller scope: enhance test coverage for YAML parsing, ensuring schema compliance without major system changes.
  Tasks:
    1. Add test cases to tests/unit/engine/test_yaml_parser.py
    2. Run pytest --target 494 passing
    3. Commit: test: expand YAML parser coverage for event structures

## Open Questions
- Should M_LOOP take precedence over M_CULTURAL for task prioritization?
- Is the YAML event schema final or subject to change post-implementation?

## Archivist Risks Addressed
- Potential misalignment of queued tasks with active milestones
