## Session Options

[R] HEADLONG — APJ Handoff Finalization [Low Risk]
  Advances: M3 — APJ Toolchain Live
  Rationale: M3 is active. Finalizing Archivist handoff integration aligns with post-YAML swarm alignment. Low risk, consolidates recent progress.
  Tasks:
    1. Implement session tracking in src/tools/apj/handoff.py
    2. Add Archivist report parsing to src/tools/apj/journal.py
    3. pytest tests/tools/test_apj_handoff.py
    4. Commit: feat: APJ handoff — integrate Archivist reports and session tracking

[D] DIVERT — Link G3 Goal [Low Risk]
  Advances: M11 — Goal Alignment (new)
  Rationale: G3 is orphaned with no milestone link — critical planning debt. Addressing ensures goal alignment and corpus coherence.
  Tasks:
    1. Review G3 in docs/goals.yaml for intended scope
    2. Update MILESTONES.md Active section with M11 — Goal Alignment
    3. Link G3 to M11 in docs/goals.yaml
    4. Run python -m src.tools.apj session start — verify risk cleared

[A] ALT — Session Log Tests [Low Risk]
  Advances: M3 — APJ Toolchain Live
  Rationale: Lower-risk test coverage expansion. Ensures session tracking stability without major feature work.
  Tasks:
    1. Add test_session_log_parsing to tests/unit/test_archivist.py
    2. Validate schema in src/shared/engine/session_log_schema.py
    3. pytest tests/unit/test_archivist.py
    4. Commit: test: session log parsing and schema validation

## Open Questions
- Should G3 be linked to a new M11 or attached to an existing Active Milestone?
- Is APJ handoff integration blocked without resolving G3 linkage first?

## Archivist Risks Addressed
- G3 orphaned with no linked milestone — addressed by Divert option
