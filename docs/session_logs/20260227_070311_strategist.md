**Model:** base_agent_router  
**Corpus Hash:** `868bd3ae79c58bcf0be948266db8badff85b0e819f6d3bd32d86f2395f0d7fbb`

## Session Options

[R] HEADLONG — Agent Swarm Base [Low Risk]
  Advances: M4 — Agent Swarm Integration
  Rationale: M4 is the active milestone. Implementing agent swarm base classes aligns with momentum on agent development. Requires adding tasks to MILESTONES.md first to comply with Archivist findings.
  Tasks:
    1. 1. Add agent swarm tasks to MILESTONES.md under M4
    2. 2. Implement AgentSwarm class in src/shared/engine/agents/swarm.py
    3. 3. pytest tests/unit/test_agent_swarm.py
    4. 4. Commit: feat: M4 — Agent swarm base implementation

[D] DIVERT — Goal-Milestone Triage [Low Risk]
  Advances: M10 — Portfolio Pass
  Rationale: Addresses critical risks: G3 orphaned, three goals without milestones, and milestones without tasks. Ensures planning hygiene.
  Tasks:
    1. 1. Link G3 to M4 in goals.yaml
    2. 2. Add tasks for Active Milestones in MILESTONES.md
    3. 3. Mark G9_OLD, G10_OLD, G11_OLD as deferred in goals.yaml
    4. 4. Commit: fix: Goal/milestone alignment per Archivist report

[A] ALT — Archivist Test Coverage [Low Risk]
  Advances: M3 — APJ Toolchain Live
  Rationale: Smaller scope: Enhance test coverage for Archivist integration, ensuring no regression.
  Tasks:
    1. 1. Add test_archivist_goal_links to tests/unit/test_apj.py
    2. 2. Validate corpus coherence in test setup
    3. 3. Commit: test: Archivist goal/milestone link checks

## Open Questions
- Is G3 critical to Agent Swarm (M4) implementation, requiring immediate linkage before proceeding?
- Should deferred goals be moved to a separate file instead of marking them in goals.yaml?

## Archivist Risks Addressed
- G3 orphaned
- Active goals without milestones
- Milestones without tasks
