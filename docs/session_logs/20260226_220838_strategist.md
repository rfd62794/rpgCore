## Session Options

[R] HEADLONG — YAML Schema Implementation [Low Risk]
  Advances: M3 — APJ Toolchain Live (enhancement)
  Rationale: Advances schema layer work critical for demo data migration. Aligns with current momentum and active milestones.
  Tasks:
    1. Update YAML entity parser in src/shared/engine/schema/yaml_loader.py
    2. Add test cases for dungeon demo data in tests/integration/test_yaml_schemas.py
    3. Run pytest — ensure 494 tests pass
    4. Commit: feat: YAML schema implementation — dungeon entities and loader tests

[D] DIVERT — Link Goals & M5 Tasks [Low Risk]
  Advances: M5 — All Four Demos Playable
  Rationale: Addresses orphaned goals and M5's missing tasks — critical planning debt blocking milestone progress.
  Tasks:
    1. Link G1-G5 to milestones in docs/MILESTONES.md
    2. Add tasks for M5 in docs/TASKS.md (e.g., 'Implement demo playtest scenes')
    3. Run python -m src.tools.apj session start — verify Archivist reports no orphaned goals
    4. Commit: chore: planning — link goals to M5, add required tasks

[A] ALT — G1 Quick Link [Low Risk]
  Advances: M11 — Living Sandbox (new)
  Rationale: Smaller scope: resolve QUEUED FOCUS by linking only G1 to a milestone.
  Tasks:
    1. Assign G1 to M11 in docs/goals.yaml
    2. Update MILESTONES.md to include M11 (Living Sandbox)
    3. Commit: chore: link G1 to M11 — Living Sandbox

## Open Questions
- Is M5 the current highest-priority milestone, requiring immediate task creation before schema work?
- Should G1 link to a new milestone (M11) or an existing one (e.g., M5)?

## Archivist Risks Addressed
- Orphaned goals (G1, G2, G4, G5) and M5 missing tasks — addressed by Divert
