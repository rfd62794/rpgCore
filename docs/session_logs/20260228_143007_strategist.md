**Model:** base_agent_router  
**Corpus Hash:** `94e3c906a1491670ac847eb62547b7f569e0f4778f07502f5979042cfec10396`

## Session Options

[R] HEADLONG — Link G3 to M5 [Low Risk]
  Advances: M5 — Agent Swarm MVP
  Rationale: M5 is active. Resolving G3 linkage ensures progress on agent swarm goals. Directly addresses queued focus.
  Tasks:
    1. 1. Update goals.yaml: link G3 to M5 in docs/goals/goals.yaml
    2. 2. Verify MILESTONES.md Active section includes M5 agent swarm scope
    3. 3. pytest tests/integration/test_goals.py
    4. 4. Commit: chore: link G3 to M5 — agent swarm foundation

[D] DIVERT — Orphan Task Triage [Low Risk]
  Advances: M10 — Portfolio Pass (planning hygiene)
  Rationale: Archivist flags two Active tasks without milestones. Fixing prevents planning debt and corpus drift.
  Tasks:
    1. 1. Audit TASKS.md Active section for unlinked tasks
    2. 2. Assign to existing milestones in MILESTONES.md or create M11
    3. 3. Update TASKS.md with milestone tags
    4. 4. Run python -m src.tools.apj session start — verify resolution

[A] ALT — Law 1 T047 Fix [Low Risk]
  Advances: M4 — Constitutional Compliance Pass
  Rationale: Quick fix for shared code referencing slime_breeder. Smaller scope, maintains constitutional compliance.
  Tasks:
    1. 1. Rename t047_slime_network.py to generic_slime_network.py in src/shared/entities/
    2. 2. Remove slime_breeder demo references from class docs
    3. 3. pytest tests/unit/test_entities.py
    4. 4. Commit: fix: LAW 1 — make T047 entity name generic

## Open Questions
- Should G3 be linked to M5 or deferred? Current M5 scope needs confirmation.
- Are the two orphaned tasks still valid Active work or should they be deprecated?

## Archivist Risks Addressed
- G3 orphaned status — addressed by Recommended
- Two Active tasks unlinked — addressed by Divert
- LAW 1 violation in T047 — addressed by Alt
