## Session Options

[R] HEADLONG — M5 Demo Playability [Low Risk]
  Advances: M5 — All Four Demos Playable
  Rationale: M5 (All four demos playable) is active but has no tasks. Adding playtest tasks ensures milestone progress without violating Constitutional Laws.
  Tasks:
    1. Update MILESTONES.md M5 section with playtest tasks for each demo in src/apps/
    2. Verify all demos launch via pytest tests/integration/test_demo_playability.py
    3. Run pytest --target 494 passing tests
    4. Commit: milestone: M5 — add playtest tasks, validate demo launches

[D] DIVERT — Goal-Milestone Linking [Low Risk]
  Advances: M10 — Portfolio Pass (planning hygiene)
  Rationale: Addresses critical risk: four Active Goals lack Milestones. Start with G1 per Queued Focus to prevent planning debt.
  Tasks:
    1. Link G1 to existing milestone or mark deferred in docs/goals.yaml
    2. Update MILESTONES.md with G1 cross-reference
    3. Run python -m src.tools.apj session start — verify Archivist reports G1 resolved
    4. Commit: goals: link G1 to milestone, update docs

[A] ALT — Corpus Parser Tests [Low Risk]
  Advances: M3 — APJ Toolchain Live (enhancement)
  Rationale: Smaller scope: enhance corpus parser validation from S005 work. Low risk with immediate test coverage.
  Tasks:
    1. Add YAML schema validation tests to tests/unit/test_corpus_parser.py
    2. Extend SessionTracker class in src/tools/apj/corpus_parser.py
    3. Run pytest --target 494 passing
    4. Commit: tests: corpus parser validation and session tracking

## Open Questions
- Should G1 (Living Sandbox) be linked to a new Milestone or deferred to future work?
- Which demos require immediate playtest fixes to meet M5 criteria?

## Archivist Risks Addressed
- Four Active Goals (G1, G2, G4, G5) have no linked Milestones — partially addressed by Divert option
