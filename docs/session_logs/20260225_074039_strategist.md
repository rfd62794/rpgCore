## Session Options

[R] M6: ALL FOUR DEMOS PLAYABLE — Milestone M6: All four demos playable [Low Risk]
  Advances: M6 — All Four Demos Playable (planning closure)
  Rationale: Linking G3 to Milestone M6 will address the open risk of G1 and ensure all demos are playable.
  Tasks:
    1. Update demo goals and milestones in src/tools/g3.py
    2. Run pytest — target 408 passing
    3. Commit: milestone M6: All four demos playable

[D] DIVERT — G1: Living Sandbox → no milestone [Low Risk]
  Advances: M10 — Portfolio Pass (planning hygiene)
  Rationale: Addressing the most critical open risk by diverting G1 and ensuring all demos are playable.
  Tasks:
    1. Read TASKS.md Active section — identify the two unlinked tasks
    2. Check MILESTONES.md Active — find appropriate milestone or create one
    3. Update MILESTONES.md and cross-reference TASKS.md
    4. Run python -m src.tools.apj session start — verify Archivist no longer flags it

[A] ALT — G3 Integration [Low Risk]
  Advances: M6 — All Four Demos Playable (planning closure)
  Rationale: Smaller scope, high leverage — integrating G3 into the existing framework will address the open risk of G1.
  Tasks:
    1. Read src/tools/g3.py get_g3()
    2. Update demo goals and milestones in src/apps/dungeon/scenes/g3_scene.py
    3. Run pytest — target 408 passing

## Open Questions
- Should the milestone M6 be targeted this session or is it better to prioritize other tasks?
- Is G3 integration a prerequisite for G1, or can it run parallel?

## Archivist Risks Addressed
- The most critical open risk addressed by Divert option
