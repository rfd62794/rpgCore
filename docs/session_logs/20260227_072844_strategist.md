## Session Options

[R] HEADLONG — Swarm Integration [Low Risk]
  Advances: M3 — APJ Toolchain Live (enhancement)
  Rationale: Archivist wiring and agent swarm integration are current priorities. Completing swarm handoff advances M3 by finalizing toolchain integration.
  Tasks:
    1. Implement agent swarm handoff in src/tools/apj/swarm_handlers.py
    2. Add test_swarm_handoff_integration to tests/unit/test_apj_swarm.py
    3. Run pytest tests/unit/test_apj_swarm.py --target 3 new passes
    4. Commit: feat: APJ agent swarm handoff integration for Archivist reports

[D] DIVERT — Orphaned Goals Triage [Low Risk]
  Advances: M10 — Portfolio Pass (planning hygiene)
  Rationale: Addresses critical risk: G3/G8/G9 lack linked milestones. Resolving ensures goal/milestone alignment and prevents planning debt.
  Tasks:
    1. Update docs/goals.yaml — link G3/G8/G9 to Active Milestones or mark deferred
    2. Verify links in MILESTONES.md Active section
    3. Run python -m src.tools.apj session start — confirm Archivist clears orphaned goal risk
    4. Commit: fix: goals.yaml — link G3/G8/G9 to Active Milestones

[A] ALT — G3 Quick Fix [Low Risk]
  Advances: M10 — Portfolio Pass (partial)
  Rationale: Smaller scope: only address Queued Focus item G3. Lower risk but partial resolution of orphaned goals.
  Tasks:
    1. Edit docs/goals.yaml — link G3 to M3 or mark deferred
    2. Run pytest tests/unit/test_goals_integration.py
    3. Commit: chore: resolve G3 milestone linkage per Queued Focus

## Open Questions
- Should unlinked goals (G8/G9) be deferred or require new Active Milestones?
- Is agent swarm integration the highest-priority M3 task, or should Archivist corpus parsing take precedence?

## Archivist Risks Addressed
- Orphaned goals G3/G8/G9 with no linked Active Milestones — addressed by Divert option
