## Session Options

[R] HEADLONG — YAML Data Layer Core [Low Risk]
  Advances: M5 — YAML Data Layer
  Rationale: M5 is active. Implementing YAML parser advances the milestone despite planning gaps. Aligns with recent validation focus.
  Tasks:
    1. Implement YAML loader in src/shared/engine/data_loader.py
    2. Migrate test data in tests/data/items.yaml to YAML format
    3. pytest tests/unit/test_data_loader.py --target 494
    4. Commit: feat: M5 YAML loader core — initial implementation with tests

[D] DIVERT — Goal-Milestone Mapping [Low Risk]
  Advances: M10 — Portfolio Pass (planning hygiene)
  Rationale: Archivist flags 4 Active Goals and M5 as unlinked. Correcting this ensures work aligns to objectives and APJ integrity.
  Tasks:
    1. Audit G1/G2/G4/G5 in goals.yaml against MILESTONES.md
    2. Link each Goal to existing or new Milestones
    3. Add M5 tasks to TASKS.md with goal cross-references
    4. Commit: chore: apj hygiene — link orphaned Goals and M5

[A] ALT — G1 Triage [Low Risk]
  Advances: M10 — Portfolio Pass (planning hygiene)
  Rationale: Resolve Queued Focus by addressing only G1 (Living Sandbox). Smaller scope than full Goal audit.
  Tasks:
    1. Edit goals.yaml: link G1 to M7 or mark deferred
    2. Update MILESTONES.md M7 description if linked
    3. Commit: chore: resolve G1 status — linked to M7/deferred

## Open Questions
- Is M5 still the priority milestone despite no linked Goals/Tasks, or should we pause to fix planning first?
- Should G1 be deferred given current YAML focus, or linked to future Sandbox Milestone?

## Archivist Risks Addressed
- Active Goals G1/G2/G4/G5 and Milestone M5 lack links — addressed by Divert
- Queued Focus G1 status — addressed by Alt
