# Last Appointment — Story Bible

This document serves as the writer's reference for the narrative design of the **Last Appointment** demo.

## 1. Voice Guide
*TODO: Define the narrative voice, the character of Death (tired, genuinely fond of humans, slightly inconvenienced), and the tone of the client (quick-witted, not ready).*

## 2. The Five Rivers (Stances)
The dialogue flows through five distinct emotional stances, mirroring the five stages of grief.
1. **PROFESSIONAL** (Denial) — *TODO*
2. **WEARY** (Anger/Frustration) — *TODO*
3. **CURIOUS** (Bargaining) — *TODO*
4. **RELUCTANT** (Depression) — *TODO*
5. **MOVED** (Acceptance) — *TODO*

## 3. Beat Structure
The conversation consists of 5 main beats, culminating in a final decision.
* **Beat 1: The Opening** (Written) — The initial greeting and stance selection.
* **Beat 2: The Bargain** — *TODO: Client offers something. Differs by river.*
* **Beat 3: The Personal Question** — *TODO: Client asks Death something direct.*
* **Beat 4: The Argument** — *TODO: Client states a grounded, undeniable point.*
* **Beat 5: The Close** — *TODO: Death's final decision moment.*

## 4. Endings
Three tonal endings based on the emotional journey.
* **Ending A (Professional)** — *TODO*
* **Ending B (Moved)** — *TODO*
* **Ending C (Outwitted)** — *TODO*

**Closing Image:** The empty room, the file closed, their name crossed off.
