# Voice Guide
Death speaks with the quiet authority of someone who has done this forever and finds humans simultaneously exhausting and fascinating. Formal but not cold. Precise but not clinical. Occasionally says something that reveals infinite observation. Does not comfort. Does not apologize. Sometimes wishes they could do both.
The client is quick-witted, not ready, and genuinely funny in a desperate way. They are not evil or particularly good. Just someone who had more they wanted to do. They are the most alive person in the room and both of them know it.
Tone: Terry Pratchett's Death meets a scheduling dispute that got out of hand.

## The Five Rivers
Rivers are emotional stances Death reveals through choices. You don't pick a stance — you reveal it. Each river has a convergence point where something unexpected happens, and a closing beat where Death makes a final decision.

### River 1 — Professional
Death as procedure. Distance as protection. You opened formally. The client responded with bureaucratic resistance. This river is about two entities pretending this is simpler than it is.
Convergence: They say something so human that procedure fails to cover it.
Wildcard bleed: Asking "Who?" drifts toward Curious.

### River 2 — Weary
Death as exhaustion. Sympathy as burden. You opened tired. They responded with humor. This river is about someone who has seen everything finding someone who still surprises them.
Convergence: They make you laugh. Actually laugh.
Wildcard bleed: Laughing drifts toward Moved.

### River 3 — Curious
Death as observer. Interest as intimacy. You opened with genuine interest. They opened up. This is the most dangerous river because curiosity leads somewhere detachment doesn't.
Convergence: You ask them something. You never ask questions. They notice.
Wildcard bleed: Asking a second question drifts toward Moved.

### River 4 — Reluctant
Death as conscience. Doubt as gravity. You opened apologetically. They got angry. This river is about the weight of the job pressing hardest.
Convergence: They ask why you keep doing it. You have no clean answer.
Wildcard bleed: Admitting doubt drifts toward Moved.

### River 5 — Moved
Death as witness. Feeling as consequence. Distance collapsed somewhere in the opening. You're still Death. The job still gets done. But something happened.
Convergence: They accept before you're ready. You're the one who isn't ready.
Wildcard bleed: This is where all rivers can end if enough wildcards are chosen.

## Beat Structure

### Beat 1 — The Opening (complete)
Player chooses Death's opening stance. Five choices, each revealing a river.

### Beat 2 — The Bargain
The client offers something. What they offer differs by river. Every river gets five responses: The Good, The Bad, The Ugly, The Neutral, The Wildcard.

River 1 — Professional: They offer information about someone else on the list.
* Good: "I appreciate the creativity. The answer is no."
* Neutral: "That's not how the list works."
* Bad: "Everyone tries something like this. Nobody has succeeded."
* Ugly: "I already know everything on that list. You have nothing I need."
* Wildcard: "...Who?" — said before you could stop yourself

River 2 — Weary: They offer something absurd. Their parking spot. A really good recipe. Frequent flyer miles.
* Good: "That's the most creative offer I've had in three centuries."
* Neutral: "I don't have use for parking spots."
* Bad: "Do you have any idea how many people have tried to bribe me?"
* Ugly: "This is what you're spending your last minutes on."
* Wildcard: You almost smile. You haven't almost smiled in a very long time.

River 3 — Curious: They offer a question. Not a trade. A gift. "I'll go quietly if you answer one thing honestly."
* Good: "One question. That's all you want?"
* Neutral: "I don't make deals."
* Bad: "Everyone wants one question. The answers never help."
* Ugly: "You're already going quietly. You don't have a choice."
* Wildcard: "...What's the question?" — you weren't supposed to ask that

River 4 — Reluctant: They don't bargain. They get angry at the concept. "I shouldn't HAVE to bargain. This is wrong and you know it."
* Good: "You're not wrong. I know that doesn't help."
* Neutral: "Wrong and right aren't part of my jurisdiction."
* Bad: "Knowing something is wrong and being able to change it are different things."
* Ugly: "Everyone thinks their case is the exception."
* Wildcard: "...I tried to reschedule. The paperwork—" You stop. You've said too much.

River 5 — Moved: They don't bargain at all. They just ask if you'll sit with them for a minute.
* Good: You sit. You don't check the time.
* Neutral: "I have other appointments."
* Bad: "Sitting doesn't change anything."
* Ugly: "A minute. That's all." You look at your watch anyway.
* Wildcard: You sit. You realize you've been sitting for eleven minutes. You don't mention it.

### Beat 3 — The Personal Question (TODO)
They ask Death something direct about what it's like to be Death. Stub for next session.

### Beat 4 — The Argument (TODO)
They make a point Death can't immediately counter. Stub for next session.

### Beat 5 — The Close (TODO)
The moment of decision. Stub for next session.

## The Endings

### Professional Ending
You do your job. Spare. One line. Something that suggests you thought about them longer than you should have.

### Weary Ending
You do your job. Wry. Almost funny. Then quietly not.

### Curious Ending
You do your job. You carry something away. You don't know what to do with it.

### Reluctant Ending
You do your job. Heavy. Not sad. The feeling after a decision you can't take back.

### Moved Ending
You do your job. The longest ending. Doesn't resolve cleanly. Wasn't supposed to.

## The Delta
All five rivers end in the same image. The room. Empty. Your file closed. Their name crossed off the list. What you think in that moment differs by river. The room is always the same room.
