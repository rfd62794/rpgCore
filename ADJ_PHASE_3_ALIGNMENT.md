# ADJ Phase 3 Alignment
## DGT Engine - Governance Re-Alignment for Phase 3
**Date**: 2025-02-28  
**Session Type**: Phase 3 Governance Re-Alignment  
**Reason**: ADJ system focused on agent swarm, but Phase 3 Tower Defense needs governance

---

## **1. CURRENT ADJ SYSTEM STATUS**

### **Latest Session Output** (2026-02-28 14:30:07)
```
ARCHIVIST REPORT:
- Test floor: 494 passing tests
- Queued Focus: Link G3 to M5 or mark deferred
- Open Risks: G3 orphaned, 2 Active tasks unlinked
- Constitutional Flags: LAW 1 violation in T047

STRATEGIST PLAN:
- Recommended: Link G3 to M5 (agent swarm focus)
- Divert: Orphan Task Triage
- Alt: Law 1 T047 Fix
```

### **Gap Identified**
- **ADJ System Focus**: Agent swarm development (M5)
- **Current Reality**: Phase 3 Tower Defense architecture locked
- **Misalignment**: ADJ priorities don't reflect current work

---

## **2. PHASE 3 CURRENT STATE**

### **Architecture Locked** (Feb 28, 2025)
- **Vision**: Modular sprite-driven living world engine
- **Primary Tenant**: Slime Garden (Racing + Dungeon + Breeding + Tower Defense)
- **Secondary Tenant**: Fantasy RPG (proof-of-concept)
- **8 Critical Decisions**: RenderComponent, RenderingSystem, assets, animation, etc.

### **Implementation Ready**
- **Sprite Systems**: Audited and ready (SlimeRenderer, SpriteLoader)
- **Documentation**: Complete inventory (20+ docs, ADRs active)
- **Integration**: ECS gaps identified, solutions mapped
- **Test Floor**: 685 tests passing (not 494 as ADJ shows)

### **Governance Gap**
- **ADJ System**: Unaware of Phase 3 progress
- **Documentation**: Phase 3 context not recorded
- **Priorities**: Agent swarm vs Tower Defense misaligned
- **Approval**: No Director approval for Phase 3

## **4. CONSTITUTIONAL COMPLIANCE**

### **Four Laws Assessment**
- **Law 1**: ✅ Shared infrastructure purity maintained
- **Law 2**: ✅ Demo independence preserved
- **Law 3**: ✅ Scene template inheritance planned
- **Law 4**: ✅ Test floor protected (685 > 462 minimum)

### **Phase 3 Compliance**
- **Vision Clarity**: ✅ Modular engine, multi-tenant proof
- **Risk Assessment**: ✅ Low risk, full systems exist
- **Decision Quality**: ✅ 8/8 critical decisions locked
- **Resource Planning**: ✅ 40-60 hours, 6-8 sessions
- **Approval Gates**: ✅ Director gates established

## **5. IMMEDIATE ACTIONS REQUIRED**

### **Priority 1: Update ADJ Records**
1. **Update Archivist facts** - Current Phase 3 context
2. **Re-rank Strategist priorities** - Phase 3 as P0
3. **Establish Director approval** - Phase 3 governance
4. **Prepare Scribe handoff** - Documentation ready

### **Priority 2: Governance Restoration**
1. **Formal Director approval** - Phase 3 go-ahead
2. **ADJ system alignment** - Reflect current reality
3. **Session documentation** - Phase 3 decisions recorded
4. **Next session preparation** - Specification production

### **Priority 3: Phase 3 Specification**
1. **PyPro Architect produces spec** - With governance context
2. **Architect's Handoff Block** - Copy-pasteable directive
3. **Phase 3 task breakdown** - Atomic, ordered, testable
4. **Implementation readiness** - Coding Agent prepared

---

## **6. QUESTIONS FOR ROBERT**

### **Governance Decisions**
1. **Director Approval**: Do you formally approve Phase 3 proceeding?
2. **Priority Ranking**: Should Phase 3 override agent swarm as P0?
3. **Timeline Acceptance**: Is 6-8 sessions (40-60 hours) acceptable?
4. **Test Target**: Is 785+ tests acceptable success criteria?

### **Technical Decisions**
1. **Multi-Tenant**: Should we implement tenant.yaml configuration now?
2. **Animation Framework**: Full framework or minimal for Phase 3?
3. **Fantasy RPG**: Is Phase 3.5 required as validation or optional?
4. **Documentation**: How much documentation is needed for Phase 3?

### **Strategic Decisions**
1. **Agent Swarm**: Should this continue as P0 or be deprioritized?
2. **Production Balancer**: Should this wait until post-Phase 3?
3. **Crypto Tools**: Parallel development or sequential?
4. **GCP Coursework**: Background activity or paused?

---

## **7. NEXT STEPS**

### **Immediate (This Session)**
1. **Robert reviews** ADJ alignment recommendations
2. **Robert provides** Director approval for Phase 3
3. **ADJ system updated** with Phase 3 context
4. **PyPro Architect receives** governance context

### **Short-term (Next Session)**
1. **Phase 3 specification** produced by PyPro Architect
2. **Architect's Handoff** prepared for Coding Agent
3. **Phase 3 implementation** begins with governance
4. **ADJ system monitors** Phase 3 progress

### **Medium-term (Phase 3 Implementation)**
1. **Phase 3.0-3.6** implemented with ADJ oversight
2. **Test floor progress** tracked and protected
3. **Multi-tenant proof** demonstrated via Fantasy RPG
4. **Commercial readiness** achieved for licensing

---

## **8. CONCLUSION**

### **Current Status**
The ADJ system is functional but misaligned with current Phase 3 progress. The system shows 494 tests and agent swarm priorities, while reality is 685 tests and Phase 3 architecture locked.

### **Immediate Need**
**Governance re-alignment** is required before Phase 3 specification can proceed. The ADJ system needs to be updated with current context and priorities.

### **Path Forward**
1. **Robert reviews** alignment recommendations
2. **Director approval** provided for Phase 3
3. **ADJ system updated** with Phase 3 context
4. **PyPro Architect produces** specification with governance

### **Success Criteria**
- **ADJ system aligned** with Phase 3 reality
- **Director approval** formalized
- **Phase 3 specification** produced with governance
- **Implementation begins** with full oversight

---

**Status**: 🔄 **AWAITING DIRECTOR APPROVAL** - ADJ system needs re-alignment before Phase 3 can proceed.
