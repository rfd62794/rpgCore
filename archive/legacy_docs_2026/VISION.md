# Slime Clan — Vision Document

## Premise

A stranded astronaut crashes on a planet locked in ancient feudal warfare between two slime factions. The player's only goal is to repair their ship and leave. Everything else — alliances, conquest, diplomacy — is a means to that end.

## Three Paths

All equally viable. None forced. The player's actions determine the ending, not dialogue choices.

### 🗡️ Conqueror
Dominate the planet. Subjugate factions. Extract what you need by force. The ship gets repaired because nobody is left to stop you.

### 🤝 Unifier
End the war. Broker peace between the factions. Build something worth staying for — or leave knowing you left the world better than you found it.

### 🚀 Survivor
Repair the ship quietly. Trade, scavenge, avoid entanglements. Leave before it gets complicated. The planet never knew your name.

## Narrative Principle

Plot and attachment emerge from play, never from cutscenes. The player should feel things before they're told to.

You recruit a slime to help carry materials and it saves your life in a skirmish. You name it. Now you care. That's the moment — and it happened because of gameplay, not a scripted sequence.

## Scope Boundary

Every feature must serve the astronaut's journey from crashed outsider to departure-ready. If a mechanic doesn't connect to ship repair, faction leverage, or survival on a hostile world — it's out of scope.

## The Four Factions

The planet has four distinct groups, each with their own identity and relationship to the war:

- **The Ember Clan (Red)** — Aggressive and expansionist. They were winning the war before the astronaut arrived. Militaristic culture, high aggression, low patience for outsiders. They see the crashed ship as a resource to be seized.
- **The Tide Clan (Blue)** — Defensive and ancient. They have held their territory for generations through discipline rather than aggression. They distrust outsiders but respect demonstrated strength.
- **The Astronaut (White)** — You. No territory, no history, no allegiance. Your color emerges on the map only as you build something. You are the only faction without a home.
- **The Unbound (Yellow)** — Tribal, scattered, neutral. They predate the war and refuse alignment with either clan. They remember what the planet was before the factions divided it. They don't fight for territory — they fight for themselves and their own. They are not hostile by default but they are not welcoming either. Trust must be earned.

## Recruitment Philosophy

The Ember and Tide Clans can be recruited through conquest or defection, but at a cost — taking their soldiers makes enemies. The Unbound are the natural recruitment pool for the astronaut. They carry no faction debt. Earning their trust is the core progression loop.

Recruitment methods are not yet defined but should involve demonstration rather than transaction. The Unbound respect capability, not currency.

## The Unbound Design Question

The Unbound exist in scattered tribal groups across unclaimed territory. They are neither aggressive nor passive — they respond to context. Three open design questions for future sessions:

1. **How do they join?** Do they recruit through combat (defeat and earn respect), relationship (repeated interaction), or demonstration (complete tasks)?
2. **Internal Politics**: Do they have their own internal hierarchy the player must navigate?
3. **Volatility**: Can they be lost — driven away by poor decisions or faction pressure?

## Day/Action System (Planned — Session 025)

Time on the overworld advances by player action, not real time. Each day the player has a limited action budget. Factions take their turn when the player ends their day.

Territories require garrisons to hold. Squads have upkeep costs. Expansion is limited by resources, not just ambition.

## Territory Purpose (Planned)

Nodes are not generic. Each has a type that determines its strategic value:

- **Ship Parts Cache** — contains components needed for departure

## Core Trade Resources
Three resources drive the economy of the planet:
- **Scrap** — salvaged metal and materials from the crashed ship and battlefield debris. The astronaut arrives with more scrap potential than any faction has ever seen. Used for equipment, fortifications, and ship repair. The slimes want it. You have it.
- **Food** — the universal currency of survival. Generated by fertile resource nodes. Consumed by squads as upkeep and by colonies as maintenance. Armies that run out of food desert. Tribes that go hungry grow desperate. Food is the pressure valve on expansion — you cannot hold everything indefinitely.
- **Crystals** — the planet's native energy resource. The slimes have always had them but treat them as ritual objects. The Unbound know where they form — deep in unclaimed territory. The astronaut recognizes them immediately: they are the fuel source your ship needs. This creates the core interdependency of the game. The slimes want your scrap and knowledge. You need their crystals. The Unbound are the bridge.

The resource triangle:
- **Scrap** — you bring it, everyone wants it
- **Food** — the world produces it, everyone needs it
- **Crystals** — the planet hides them, you need them most

## Knowledge and Trust Systems
The astronaut is not just a warrior or a conqueror. You carry something none of the factions have: knowledge from beyond this world.

Knowledge is the astronaut's unique resource. It accumulates through observation, exploration, and surviving encounters. It cannot be taken by force — only earned through experience. Knowledge is spent on technological improvements that benefit whoever you share them with:
- Better tools increase a squad's attack
- Medicine reduces unit casualties after battle
- Construction methods improve fortification of strongholds
- Navigation charts reveal hidden crystal deposits

Trust is relational currency. It is faction-specific and asymmetric — the Ember Clan's trust and the Unbound's trust are earned differently and spent differently:
- **Ember Clan trust**: earned through demonstrated strength, lost through mercy
- **Tide Clan trust**: earned through consistency and keeping agreements, lost through aggression
- **Unbound trust**: earned through patience and demonstration, lost through broken promises or faction alignment

Trust enables:
- Recruitment of Unbound slimes
- Defection of Red and Blue soldiers
- Trade agreements for crystals and food
- Safe passage through neutral territory

*Defection System: Each night during End Day resolution, units near the player with high sympathy scores have a small chance of defecting. Sympathy is modified by player actions — sparing defeated enemies, protecting neutral nodes, sharing resources. Defectors arrive as recruitable units with their faction's combat style but no faction loyalty.*

The astronaut who shares knowledge freely builds trust faster but depletes a finite resource. The astronaut who hoards knowledge stays powerful but remains alone. This tension defines the Unifier versus Survivor versus Conqueror paths at a mechanical level.

## The Crystal Connection
Crystals are why the Unbound matter beyond their combat value. They know the planet. They know where crystals form, which territories are rich, which are depleted. Earning Unbound trust does not just give you soldiers — it gives you a map to going home.

The Conqueror finds crystals through conquest. The Unifier finds them through partnership. The Survivor finds just enough through careful trade. All three paths lead to the same ship, repaired differently.
