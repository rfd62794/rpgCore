# Dead Tests Archive 2026

These tests have been archived because they reference modules that no longer exist in the codebase.
This includes old systems like `world_ledger`, `dgt_core`, `rpg_core`, `semantic_engine`, and various other deprecated architectural stubs.

They are kept here for historical reference and should not be run by pytest.
