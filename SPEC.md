# Project Specification: Inventory Directive

## Directive Summary
Perform a complete repository inventory of `rpgCore`. Do not modify any files. Produce a markdown report saved as `docs/INVENTORY.md`.

## Technical Requirements
1. **Directory structure** — full tree, all folders and files.
2. **Component inventory** — for each Python file outside of `slime_clan`, a one-line summary of what it does or contains.
3. **System inventory** — identify any reusable systems already present (game loops, rendering methods, input handlers, entity systems, physics, UI components, etc.).
4. **Slime Clan summary** — one paragraph describing what `territorial_grid.py` currently provides as a reusable system.
5. **Gaps** — what systems would be needed for an Overworld screen that don't currently exist.

## Constraints
- **No code changes**. Inventory and report only.
- Commit `docs/INVENTORY.md` to `main` when complete.
